        <paragraph>The name
            <quote>Discovery based Networks of Perspectives and Changes</quote>
            or in short
            <quote>Den</quote>
            is quite long, in order to provide a name, that is also kind of the definition
            of the thing in question. It is a concept in order to describe, understand and work with
            any information and changes done on these.

            <paragraph>A perspective is a node in a directed graph.
                A <quote>network of perspectives</quote> is a directed graph.
                A <quote>discovery based network of perspectives</quote> is a graph with multiple conditions:
            </paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>There is a formal root node, which is the starting point.</item>
                <item>All perspectives are reachable from the root node.</item>
                <item>There is a known in/formal grammar (i.e. a context free grammar) for the graph,
                    that also creates a semantic meaning of the graph from the point of view of the root node.
                </item>
            </list>
            <paragraph>A
                <quote>Discovery based Network of Perspectives and Changes</quote>
                is a <quote>Discovery based Network of Perspectives</quote>, where a formalism
                for the history of changes exists.
                It may or may not constraint the possible changes of such a system.
