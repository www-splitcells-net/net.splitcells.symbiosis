            Add support for book format to the XML format.
            Book format means in this context, that a set of documents has a specific natural order,
            which can be used to render set documents as a book.
            This provides a reading flow, so that the user can read all documents as one without complex navigation.
            This is mostly useful for projects, that are books or similar.

    <paragraph>
        Some may define Symbiosis as living together,
        but what does this mean?
        Why is it so hard to define,
        but so easy to grasp?
