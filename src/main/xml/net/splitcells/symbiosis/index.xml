        <d:tDo>
            Add support for book format to the XML format.
            Book format means in this context, that a set of documents has a specific natural order,
            which can be used to render set documents as a book.
            This provides a reading flow, so that the user can read all documents as one without complex navigation.
            This is mostly useful for projects, that are books or similar.

    <paragraph>
        Some may define symbiosis as living together of beings,
        but what does this mean and what are the consequences?
        This project attempts to define symbiosis,
        inorder to study the living together of source code.
        The focus is on open source code as this study is part of the Splitcells open source project.
        It aims for a greater understanding of the Splitcells project's interactions with the wider world.
