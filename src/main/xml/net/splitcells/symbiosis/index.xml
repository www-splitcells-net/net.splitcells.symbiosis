        <d:todo>Intelligence is sometimes seen as the capability to see the future.
            A difference of prediction capability makes working together harder or even incompatible.
            Compare a nation, that needs to do warfare, in order to survive, compared to a nation,
            that never needed to do this.

        Some may define symbiosis as living together of beings, but what does this mean and what are the consequences?
        Why is it so easy to understand, but so hard to grasp?
        In this project we try to define and explore symbiosis from the perspective of computer science.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        How does one model living beings mathematically in order to reason about it?
        Life seems to be mainly focused on self-sustaining and reproduction.
        A straight forward approach to formulate this mathematically is to define
        this focus as an optimization that maximizes self-sustaining of every existing living instance
        and to maximize the amount of living instances.
        As we are just starting this journey,
        the weighting between these goals is considered to be unknown or random for now.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        In order to simplify things even further at the beginning,
        we consider the definition of symbiosis to be the living together of any optimizations.
        Thereby we also rule out, that the definition is too narrow.
        The optimizations may be represented by actual living beings or just its genes,
        but computer programs and their source code are also considered as such in this context.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        We now have a semantic starting point and goal.
        If the definition turns out to be false,
        we will adapt it together,
        if not we were lucky.
        So, let's get started and see where the voyage will take us.
