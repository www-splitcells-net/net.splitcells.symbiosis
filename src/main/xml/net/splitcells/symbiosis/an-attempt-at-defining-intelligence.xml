        <paragraph>This article tries to forge a definition of intelligence.
            The background of the starting point for this attempt is computer science.
            The most important requirement for the definition is the maximization of its usability.

                        The Turing test
                    </link>
                    can be seen as an attempt to better understand intelligent behavior of humans.
                    It does not try to define intelligent human behavior explicitly,
                    nor does it state that human behavior is not dull.
                    Instead, it defines a way to determine,
                    if something is a human behavior or not.
                    If human behavior is seen as inherently intelligent,
                    then this test may be able to detect a subset of intelligent behaviour.
                    It firstly isolates all important factors of the examined subject and
                    secondly strictly states,
                    which properties can be used in order to classify the subject.
                    A downside of this approach is the fact,
                    that not all intelligent human behavior can be classified as such,
                    because biological processes are not considered.
                    It is implied, that human in general are able to distinguish between human behavior and
                    other behavior.
                    The Turing test itself does not predict any concrete properties of humans or intelligence.

                    Requiring intelligence to do global optimization,
                    does not seem to make sense,

                    In this context it is assumed, that emotional intelligence,
                    is intelligence applied to a subset of things.

                <title>Type Signature of an Intelligence Definition</title>
                <paragraph>Simply speaking, the aim of this definition is to
                    determine, if a
                    given process is intelligent or not. In this context, it is
                    assumed that
                    all aspects of a reviewed process are visible, in order to simplify the definition.
                    It is also assumed, that an instance of intelligence is equivalent to
                    an intelligent process. This in turns allows one to describe an data structure for intelligence.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>The formal type signature is:</paragraph>
                <list>
                    <item>Formally a process w is defined as a string of Σ, where Σ is an non empty alphabet:
                        <quote>w ∊ Σ</quote>.
                    </item>
                    <item>An intelligence definition is a classifier of any process w:
                        <quote>intelligent(w) = 1 if w is intelligent else 0</quote>
                    </item>

                <title>Additional Intelligence Definition Implementation Requirements</title>
                <paragraph>The most important requirement to such an implementation
                    is, that it has to be useful.
                    It should not contradict other theories except for other intelligence definition.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Such an implementation shall be useful at least for a
                    nonempty subset of all actors, who can benefit from intelligent process
                    identification.
                    In the ideal case this set should contain all such actors. An actor
                    finds it useful to identify intelligent processes, if a
                    cost free usage of
                    such a
                    definition has benefits for that actor. This implies that actors are
                    optimization systems.
                </paragraph>
                <d:todo>Formalize the maximization of the usefulness of the intelligence classification.</d:todo>
                <paragraph>The implementation shall have such a structure, that third
                    parties can be convinced, that the given construct in fact defines intelligence.

                <title>Objectives' Properties</title>
                <paragraph>
                    The aim of defining intelligence is not entirely objective. Also,
                    there is a formal and objective signature of an intelligence
                    definition, the additional implementation requirements require
                    an already present intelligence definition.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>The set of actors who can benefit from intelligent
                    process
                    identification, is also not completely documented in detail as it
                    also implicitly
                    depends on an already present intelligence definition.
                    This in turn could lead to a circular definition.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>The fact that such a definition has only
                    to be useful to a subset of actors, who can benefit from intelligent
                    process
                    identification, indicates that there are possibly a multitude of
                    intelligence definitions. This in turn indicates, that an intelligence
                    definition may be partially depended on the observer in question.

            <title>Related Speculations</title>
            <paragraph>The possible relativity of intelligence may be related
                to the algorithmic complexity and
                the processing capabilities of the
                observer and its objects in
                question. This seems to be
                compatible to the observation, that it is hard to describe or understand
                intelligent behavior in detail. It
                may even explain, why a part of artificial intelligence development
                seems to be driven by gains
                in information
                processing efficiency as access to more capable
                hardware allows one to execute
                more
                complex algorithms.

            <title>An Intelligence Definition</title>
            <paragraph>An intelligence is defined via a classifier as this in accordance to the intelligence definition
                signature:
                <quote>intelligent(w) = 1 if w is a random optimization else 0</quote>.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Randomness is defined in this context, as information/thing that is not accessible from the
                perspective of the actor. Note that this does not state, if there is indeterminism or not.
                This also does not state, that everything is deterministic.
                Neither does it state, why the information is not accessible.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>A random optimization is an optimization, where the objective/constraint is random.
                This means, that an actor is not able to determine the objective of an intelligence completely by
                definition.
                This also means, that intelligence is subjective by this definition.

            <d:toDo>The question of intelligence is irrelevant (i.e. autonomy, free will, politics already provide
                similar definitions)
                for most.
