                It may be important to have a will.
            </d:todo>
            <d:toDo>Is this relevant?

            <d:toDo>Could human rights be applicable for AI?</d:toDo>
            <d:toDo>An entity from an alien race lands on earth and can communicate with humans.
                Humans notice it as an intelligent living being because of its behaviour,
                but later find in its landing craft a manual.
                The manual unambiguously states, that the entity is a roboter.
                Do you kill the roboter, in order to find out how to reproduce the roboter,
                so you can live in the future without having to work?
                Alternatively, do you grant the entity human rights or something similar?

    <paragraph>This article tries to forge a definition of intelligence.
        The background of the starting point for this attempt is computer science.
        The most important requirement for the definition is the maximization of its usability.
