            <title>Type Signature of an Intelligence Definition</title>
            <paragraph>Simply speaking, the aim of this definition is to
                determine, if a
                given process is intelligent or not. In this context, it is
                assumed that
                all aspects of a reviewed process are visible, in order to simplify the definition.
                It is also assumed, that an instance of intelligence is equivalent to
                an intelligent process. This in turns allows one to describe an data structure for intelligence.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>The formal type signature is:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>Formally a process w is defined as a string of Σ, where Σ is an non empty alphabet:
                    <quote>w ∊ Σ</quote>.
                </item>
                <item>An intelligence definition is a classifier of any process w:
                    <quote>intelligent(w) = 1 if w is intelligent else 0</quote>
                </item>
            </list>

            <title>Additional Intelligence Definition Implementation Requirements</title>
            <paragraph>The most important requirement to such an implementation
                is, that it has to be useful.
                It should not contradict other theories except for other intelligence definition.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>Such an implementation shall be useful at least for a
                nonempty subset of all actors, who can benefit from intelligent process
                identification.
                In the ideal case this set should contain all such actors. An actor
                finds it useful to identify intelligent processes, if a
                cost free usage of
                such a
                definition has benefits for that actor. This implies that actors are
                optimization systems.
            </paragraph>
            <d:todo>Formalize the maximization of the usefulness of the intelligence classification.</d:todo>
            <paragraph>The implementation shall have such a structure, that third
                parties can be convinced, that the given construct in fact defines intelligence.
            </paragraph>
        </chapter>

            <title>Objectives' Properties</title>
            <paragraph>
                The aim of defining intelligence is not entirely objective. Also,
                there is a formal and objective signature of an intelligence
                definition, the additional implementation requirements require
                an already present intelligence definition.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>The set of actors who can benefit from intelligent
                process
                identification, is also not completely documented in detail as it
                also implicitly
                depends on an already present intelligence definition.
                This in turn could lead to a circular definition.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>The fact that such a definition has only
                to be useful to a subset of actors, who can benefit from intelligent
                process
                identification, indicates that there are possibly a multitude of
                intelligence definitions. This in turn indicates, that an intelligence
                definition may be partially depended on the observer in question.

        <title>Related Speculations</title>
        <paragraph>The possible relativity of intelligence may be related
            to the algorithmic complexity and
            the processing capabilities of the
            observer and its objects in
            question. This seems to be
            compatible to the observation, that it is hard to describe or understand
            intelligent behavior in detail. It
            may even explain, why a part of artificial intelligence development
            seems to be driven by gains
            in information
            processing efficiency as access to more capable
            hardware allows one to execute
            more
            complex algorithms.

        <title>An Intelligence Definition</title>
        <paragraph>An intelligence is defined via a classifier as this in accordance to the intelligence definition
            signature:
            <quote>intelligent(w) = 1 if w is a random optimization else 0</quote>.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Randomness is defined in this context, as information/thing that is not accessible from the
            perspective of the actor. Note that this does not state, if there is indeterminism or not.
            This also does not state, that everything is deterministic.
            Neither does it state, why the information is not accessible.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>A random optimization is an optimization, where the objective/constraint is random.
            This means, that an actor is not able to determine the objective of an intelligence completely by
            definition.
            This also means, that intelligence is subjective by this definition.

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <d:toDo>The question of intelligence is irrelevant (i.e. autonomy, free will, politics already provide
            similar definitions)
            for most.
