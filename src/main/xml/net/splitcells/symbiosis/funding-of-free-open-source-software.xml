        <title>Funding Free Open Source Software (FOSS)</title>
        <description>
            When people are working on free software, they would like to be paid for it.
            Of course this conflicts with the fact, that the software itself is free of charge itself.
            One can charge money for additional services like file hosting,
            server hosting, community services, support and so on.
            But it does not change the fact, that software itself can be used in principle by anyone.

            When people are working on free software, they would like to be paid for it.
            Of course this conflicts with the fact, that the software itself is free of charge itself.
            One can charge money for additional services like file hosting,
            server hosting, community services, support and so on.
            But it does not change the fact, that software itself can be used in principle by anyone.

            A classic approach to tackle the problem is to raise money through

                    One idea was

                to display advertisement in the terminal during the installation process of the open source program.

        <title>FOSS Core with Proprietary Extension</title>
        <paragraph>
            One other solution is to have the core application being FOSS
            <link url="https://www.golem.de/news/open-source-angriff-von-zwei-seiten-2002-146769-2.html">
                while selling non-FOSS extensions
            </link>.
            In such a constellation such extensions can be made FOSS
            when the functionality of such extensions becomes common enough that it is not critical
            for funding anymore.
            See
            <link url="https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver">timefold</link>
            as an example.
